# Knapsack-MST
Knapsack problem and a minimum spanning tree in Java.
This lab is to showcase advanced algorithms using two difficult problems, the knapsack and a minimum spanning tree. In the Graph file, we are using Kruskal's technique in order to sort the edges of the graph by weight and adding them to the MST if they do not create a cycle. It uses union-find data structures to  detect and merge subsets of vertices as well. In the second file for the knapsack problem, we are trying to find the max value value that can be put into a knapsack. It iteratively calculates the max achievable value based on item weights, values, and remaining knapsack capacity, while the main method provides example item values and weights, specifies the maximum knapsack capacity, and prints the max achievable value for the capacity.
